# StudentReport
Combined multiple reports from a company's website. The company and its website URLs have been redacted.

This was a project I designed while working as a manager for a Maths Learning Centre.

It uses the Selenium library to login to the company website using the user's username and password, navigate through the needed report webpages and create a single excel spreadhseet, fit with conditional formatting.
